# BetaJournalAndroid

A journal-based Android application designed to record a climber's sends. You can track which bouldering grade you got an Onsight, Flash, or Redpoint for. You can also track which grades you didn't send. Once you have tracked your sends, you can check out the "Stats" page where you'll see the count of each grade you've sent, along with your "Most Climbed" grade and your "Highest Grade" grade.
